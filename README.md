# Express rest api

A [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) rest api using [express](https://expressjs.com/).

## Requirements

[Git](https://git-scm.com/), [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://npm.community/).

## How to set up (locally)

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/nwnordahl/express-rest-api
```

2. Install the required packages in the cloned repository with npm:

```bash
$ npm i
```

3. Run server:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

If you see 'Server running on port 5000' in the terminal then you are good to go!

## How to use

Make sure that you have done the steps above. Communication with the api can then be done with programs like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) and [Isomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), or with the [Rest Client plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) using the "requests.http" file.
